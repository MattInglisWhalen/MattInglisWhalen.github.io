    ### Movie Review Sentiment

    A small project for me to learn how to deploy models to a server. Here a simple bag-of-words model to predict the sentiment of a provided movie review. [Try it out yourself]          (https://mattingliswhalen.github.io/demos/movie_review_sentiment.html) or read more about the model at the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/MattInglisWhalen/MovieReviewSentiments)!

    ### MIW's AutoFit

    This project was originally meant to be marketed online to researchers and professionals that needed a quick way to determine the best functional model to fit their 1D data. This       multiplatform GUI is compatible with Windows, MacOSX, and Ubuntu.
