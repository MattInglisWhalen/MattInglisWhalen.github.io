I am a newly minted physics PhD looking to transfer my skills to the Data Science industry. I'm passionate about 
estimating uncertainties in a model's output, and love good visualizations comparing raw data to model predictions.

For hiring teams, please visit my portfolio section to view and interact with my completed projects.
