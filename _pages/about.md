I am a newly minted physics PhD looking to transfer my skills to the Data Science industry. I'm passionate about 
estimating uncertainties in a model's output, and I love good visualizations that compare raw data to a model's predictions.

For hiring teams, please visit my portfolio section to view and interact with my completed projects.

### News:

- April 2024 --- My R package [ClusterByDensity](https://github.com/MattInglisWhalen/ClusterByDensity) can now be used to find clusters in 2D point-spread datasets. Read about it [here](https://mattingliswhalen.github.io/blog/2024-04-08--2D-Clusters)!
- December 2023 --- I've uploaded my DataCamp [final project](https://github.com/MattInglisWhalen/RecipeSiteTraffic) that goes through the entire pipeline of data cleaning, exploratory analysis, model building, and model appraisal.
- November 2023 --- [Tutorial pages](https://mattingliswhalen.github.io/MIWs_AutoFit_Tutorial_1/) for MIW's AutoFit are now live.
- October 2023 --- I've built a rudimentary sentiment analysis model using Kaggle's [Netflix Movie Rating](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rishitjavia/netflix-movie-rating-dataset) dataset. I deployed the model to an EC2-instance so that you can [check it out](http://ec2-18-216-26-152.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com/mrs_demo) for yourself! Or read the blog post [here](https://mattingliswhalen.github.io/blog/2023-10-12--sentiment-analysis-micro).
- August 2023 --- Completed DataCamp's Professional Data Scientist certification.
- March 2023 --- I stumbled across a code golf [stack exchange](https://codegolf.stackexchange.com/questions/8629/fastest-semiprime-factorization) post about quickly factoring large prime numbers using a Multiple Polynomial Quadratic Sieve. I've immortalized the post's content in my [FastFactor](https://github.com/MattInglisWhalen/FastFactor) repo, updated for Python 3.x 
- December 2022 --- [MIW's AutoFit](https://github.com/MattInglisWhalen/MIW_AutoFit) is now available for download.
- March 2022 --- I defended my [thesis](https://tspace.library.utoronto.ca/handle/1807/123124), completing my PhD in particle physics at the University of Toronto
- October 2021 --- Met the PhD quota! My third paper [Factorization of Power Corrections in the Drell-Yan Process in EFT ](https://journals.aps.org/prd/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevD.104.076018) has been published in Phys Rev D!
- October 2021 --- After a year of arguing with reviewers, our new article [Rapidity logarithms in SCET without modes](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0375947421001251?via%3Dihub) has been published in Nucl Phys A.
- March 2019 --- I presented our prelimary work on the cancellation of rapidity divergences at the annual [SCET workshop](https://indico.physics.lbl.gov/event/694/timetable/#20190325.detailed) in San Diego.
- May 2018 --- My first THEP publication, entitled [Renormalization of dijet operators at order 1/QÂ² in Soft-Collinear Effective Theory](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/JHEP05(2018)023), has been published by JHEP!
